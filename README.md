# Finance Essentials

An ES6 React app that hooks into Yahoo's finance api and monitors different assets for you and updates every 5 minutes. The assets are stored locally so that when you renavigate to the site they are still being monitored. To monitor a stock, index, or currency, click on the eye icon while searching. To unmonitor, click that same icon, or click the other eye icon next to the asset's symbol. You can also access chart data by clicking the symbol or name in the watch list, or by clicking on the element displayed when searching. You can try the demo version [here](financeessentials-11afc.firebaseapp.com)
